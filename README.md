# GMU Department Website Submission 🚀

Welcome to the **GMU Department Website Submission Repository**.  
This repository is created for submitting the websites designed for the upcoming event.  

Each participant should create **their own branch** (with their **name as the branch name**) and upload their website files there.  
👉 Do **not** upload directly to the `main` branch.

## 🔹 Steps to Submit Your Website

Follow the steps carefully:

### 1. Fork the Repository
1. Click on the **Fork** button (top right of this page).  
   This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.  

### 2. Clone Your Fork
On your computer, open **Git Bash / Terminal** and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gmu_dpt_website_submission.git
```

Then move into the project folder:
```bash
cd gmu_dpt_website_submission
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
Each participant must create a **separate branch** with their **full name**.  

Example (replace with your own name):
```bash
git checkout -b John-Doe
```

📌 Branch name format:
- Use your full name (First-Last)  
- If your name has spaces, replace with `-` (hyphen).  
- Example: `Priya-Kumar`, `Ravi-Shankar`.

### 4. Add Your Website Files
Copy your project files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) into the folder.  

Make sure your files are **inside a folder named with your name** for clarity.  
Example:
```
/John-Doe/index.html
/John-Doe/style.css
/John-Doe/images/
```

### 5. Stage & Commit
Run the following commands:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added website submission by John Doe"
```

### 6. Push to Your Branch
Push your branch to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin John-Doe
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.  
2. Click on **Compare & Pull Request**.  
3. Select your branch and submit the PR.  

✅ Once your PR is merged, your website is officially submitted.
